At the Android Study Jam, you will learn to develop your
first Android app, including basic XML and Kotlin, creating user interfaces and
handling the user input.

On 2018 we celebrate the 4th edition of our Android Study Jam!
And we have new content! We are going to teach you Android using Kotlin:
A popular programming language that is easier to
use than Java, it is fully supported for Android apps and it's in high demand for Android
developers.

On the first session, we will do a live introduction to Kotlin using [Try Kotlin website](https://try.kotlinlang.org/).
You don't need to install anything, it runs on the browser. This introduction is
aimed for non developers.

Then, we will be following the codelab: [Build your first Android app in Kotlin](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/build-your-first-android-app-kotlin/#0).

The course is aimed for anyone who is interested in learning Android and
creating their first app. Previous programming experience is recommended but
not mandatory. The first session will have an intro to Kotlin for non-developers.

#### How we work

We will meet Tuesdays from 19:00 to 21:00 for six weeks.

During the six scheduled sessions, we will follow the codelab
[Build your first Android app in Kotlin](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/build-your-first-android-app-kotlin/#0)
and we will go step by step through all the content. See the agenda below.

Working at home is not required but is encouraged.

Android developers, named as coaches, will be present on
the study jam session to help the students.

We recommend you to attend to all sessions, but skipping a session and doing the
codelab at home is perfectly possible.
