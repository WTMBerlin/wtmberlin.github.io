At the Android Study Jam, you will learn to develop your
first Android app, including basic XML and Kotlin, creating user interfaces and
handling the user input.

On 2018 we celebrate the 4th edition of our Android Study Jam!
And we have new content! We are going to teach you Android using Kotlin:
A popular programming language that is easier to
use than Java, it is fully supported for Android apps and it's in high demand for Android
developers.

On the first session, we will do a live introduction to Kotlin using [Try Kotlin website](https://try.kotlinlang.org/).
You don't need to install anything, it runs on the browser. This introduction is
aimed for non developers.

Then, we will be following the codelab: [Build your first Android app in Kotlin](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/build-your-first-android-ap).

The course is aimed for anyone who is interested in learning Android and
creating their first app. Previous programming experience is recommended but
not mandatory. The first session will have an intro to Kotlin for non-developers.
