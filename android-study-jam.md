During the duration of the Android Study Jam, you will learn to develop your
first Android app, including basic XML and Java, creating user interfaces and
handling the user input. No previous programming experience is needed to
complete this course!

The Android Study Jam is based on the
[http://developerstudyjams.com/](http://developerstudyjams.com/) and it is
defined as a series of free, community run, in-person study groups.

We will be following the Android Basics: User Interface and Android Basics: User
Input from Udacity.

The course is aimed for anyone who is interested in learning Android and
creating their first app. No previous programming experience is required.
Although the events are part of the Women Techmakers activities, all genders
are welcome to join the sessions.

#### How we work

The students are expected to follow the online course at home and use the study
jam session as support. Android developers, named as coaches, will be present on
the study jam session to help the students.

About 3 hours/week of work are required to complete the course on time.

Also, the students will develop their first app during the course and will
present the app on the graduation event.

The students will graduate only if they present the app at the end of the course.
It is not mandatory to attend to all the study jam sessions. The students
that graduate will receive a certificate of completion and some prizes for the
best presented apps.

**Usual Agenda**

- Introduction: News from the community and agenda presentation (15 minutes)
- Review of the last lesson: A coach will prepare the review and do a short
presentation of the new concepts learned so everyone is on the same page (30 minutes)
- Break.
- Work together of coaches and students
