I recently had the opportunity to attend the [JavaScript Crash Course Berlin](http://wtmberlin.com/javascript-crash-course/).
It was a 2 months course, the lectures were every Thursday from 6:30 PM to 10 PM and the goal of the course was 
 _To introduce JavaScript and Node.js as a platform for backend applications._ 

At first, when I signed up for the course, I was unsure if I was going to make it until the end, 8 weeks seemed like a 
long time and December seemed so far away. How wrong I was! Time passed so quickly, and I felt so at peace during the
course. Even when I had a rough Thursday I always new everything would be better the moment I reached the 
[course location](https://king.com/de) and the lecture started. It happened every time. 

The course was very well structured and the instructor was very experienced. It was so amazing to see how 
[Armağan](https://arm.ag/) (our instructor) captured the attention of all the attendees and kept all of us engaged, 
even though the attendees came from different backgrounds or were at different stages in our Software Development
Careers, some were getting started and others already had some experience, for example as Software Developers. 


I had such a great time during the course! Every time a week started I was so looking forward for Thursday to arrive! 
And then when Thursday arrived I would wake up and say: Yay! It is JavaScript Day! It is JavaScript day! :dancer:


I was surprised by the amount of content that we were able to cover in just 2 months! The graduation event was
**awesome**. I felt so inspired by the projects that were presented and to see all my classmate's ideas coming to life.

I will definitely keep going to these events and I will keep learning new things. I consider it is important to go back
to the basics, to learn something new and different, to be in a safe environment and allow yourself to be out of your
comfort zone. 

By re-learning the basics, you will discover new things. It is like watching again and again that movie that you love 
so much and you just do not get tired of watching, even if you already kind of know the script 
(ehem ... Star Wars Episode VI ... ehem). Or reading your favorite book many times, you will remember something you
forgot you loved, or you will find a new phrase that had not made sense to you in the past but it does now.

The adventure of this course not only helped me learn and understand better a new programming language and a new way of
thinking, it did something way more important for me: It helped me remember _why_ I chose this path, _why_ I chose to
become a Software Engineer, _why_ I felt in love with Technology. I felt so safe to fail, I felt so free to learn.
Sometimes we get so deep into the cycle of our day to day work, of our routine, that we forget our roots, that we
forget the joy of creating something new, the simple _Joy of Programming_. 

Thank you so much to [Armağan Amcalar](https://arm.ag/) for taking the time to prepare and teach this course! 
To [Women Techmakers Berlin](http://wtmberlin.com/) for organizing the course. And to my colleagues, friends and family
for their support during these two months.

Finally, if you are interested on the course, you will be very happy to know that all the lectures were recorded, 
you just need to visit the [course site](http://wtmberlin.com/javascript-crash-course/) and give them a try! :smiley:
